            amazing culture, Plus, the cuisine Here is completely Phenomenal.

            <br />
            <br />
            Antalya, city and Mediterranean Sea port, southwestern Turkey. It is
            situated on the Gulf of Antalya. Attalia was founded as a seaport in
            the 2nd century bce by Attalus II Philadelphus, a king of Pergamum.
            It was bequeathed to the Romans by his successor, Attalus III
            Philometor Euergetes.
            <br />
            <br />
            Frequently repeated and most well-known version of the history of
            Antalya states that the city was founded in the Hellenistic period,
            around 150 BCE, by Attalos II, king of Pergamon. The city was then
            called Attalia, reflecting its founder's name. Over time this word
            was distorted and now exists as Antalya.

              <h4>Cafe Çay-Tea</h4>
              <p>
                Çay tea, pronounced "chai", is a variant of black tea and is
                firmly rooted in Turkish culture. Whether with a Turkish
                breakfast or after a good dinner – the soothing beverage is
                consumed at any time of day. Prepared in special teapots, Çay is
                served in tulip-shaped glasses with a little sugar.
